music player
 Here I use HTML,CSS and JavaScript. HTML provides the basic structure of this page (music player ), which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different buttons like forward ,rewind play-pause etc.
